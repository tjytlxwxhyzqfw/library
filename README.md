# Library

Most libraris here are my daily used</br>
data structures and algorithms for online judgement,</br>
while others are:

- A **numerical analysis** library in c/src/na
- Some **classic algorithms** I found in IA or some where else
- A little **blacktech**, like C functional programming utilities :P
