# About this library

This library is under a rewritting process !

This library derived from my "Numberical Analysis" course about
a year ago. I was coding with a juvenile sytle at that time
(I currently coding with the kernel style).

For example, I write functions like this:

```C
int
main {
}
```

And I was abusing `typedef`. Besides I was even not familiar with
`make` tools then. It's terrible.

But the library is just so good, I like it and I may actually employ
some of the algorithms here for my ML learning process. This is why
I made a decision to rewrite it recently.

It will be wonderful. :)
